In this research project, I developed an eco friendly denim dyeing and coating method that replaces synthetic indigo and petroleum based resins with natural indigo extracted from Assam indigo leaves and biodegradable plant protein adhesives sourced from imperfect coffee beans and soybeans. I optimized the protein precipitation process (including testing pH and temperature conditions) and applied the protein based coating to denim textiles to achieve consistent color attachment. To evaluate durability in a realistic, low cost way, I also designed and built custom washing fastness and rubbing fastness testing devices using discarded appliance materials, then benchmarked performance against commercial resin and commercially available jeans. The coated textiles achieved strong fastness results (about grade 4 to 5), showing the feasibility of a scalable, sustainable alternative for the denim industry. This project received a utility patent in Taiwan.
