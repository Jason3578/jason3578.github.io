For this fluid mechanics dissection project, my teammates and I took apart a low cost single cup coffee brewer and documented both its external layout and internal flow hardware. Externally, the unit has a simple plastic shell, a basic rocker power switch, and a small drip area that showed heavy staining and residue, which suggests inconsistent heating and poor long term cleanliness or maintenance performance. 
After removing the housing, we exposed a very minimal internal fluid system. Two flexible silicone tubes route the flow into and out of a compact metal heating assembly, with basic clamps and limited strain relief. The heating section consists of a bent metal tube and a small chamber area surrounded by electrical components and heat protection (thermal sensor or fuse) with braided sleeving on wires for insulation. Overall, the construction quality appeared low, with few sealing features and a simplified flow path, making it a good example of how cost driven design can lead to higher flow resistance at fittings, greater risk of leakage, and less consistent flow rate. From a fluid mechanics perspective, this device is useful for analyzing the complete water path from reservoir to outlet and connecting observed design choices to pressure driven flow, minor losses in bends and connectors, and the relationship between heating and the pressure head that drives the brew flow.
