Our final group work in MAE 3260 System Dynamics investigates the dynamics and control of a quadrotor as a representative multi-input/output system. Our group chose a quadrotor because quadrotors are widely used in inspection, delivery, and war tasks, where precise and safe maneuvering is critical. We aim to derive dynamic models through obtaining ODEs, transfer functions, and state space models for key aspects(pitching, yawing, and throttling). By using these models, we will analyze the open-loop and closed-loop behaviors with step response and Bode plot through MATLAB. Our ultimate goal is to combine the course concepts and utilize them in our derivation of the system dynamics of the quadrotor.
